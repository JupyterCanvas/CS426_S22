## UNR Environment Deployment and Jupyter Notebooks for Canvas

We are creating a custom installation of JupiterHub for UNR that integrates 
Jupiter Notebooks, container provisioning with Singularity, or VM provisioning 
with the Nevada Cyber Range, into Canvas - for use in Computer Science education 
by the University of Nevada Reno's CSE department and Cybersecurity Center.
